Hey Mark, Mike, and Joe, 

On 10-13-16 Bloomberg reported, “Trump Said to Block Campaign’s Requests to Do Self-Opposition Research — The decision contributed to his campaign being caught unprepared for the past week’s barrage of claims he mistreated women.” That’s not what’s going on here, though. This is my homework. If you’re not Mark, Mike, or Joe, then maybe you should stop creeping, but that’s just a suggestion.
